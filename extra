## NOTE: if you see a message like so, running this on a Mac computer:
## 0:94: execution error: "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/bears-adventure/id495954957?i=495955054&uo=4" doesn’t understand the “open location” message. (-1708)
## That's an Apple-related error but will not cause you a problem. Don't worry about it.
