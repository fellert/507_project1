<h1>SI507 - Project 1</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

    <li>SI507F17_project1_cards.py: contains function code</li>
    <li>SI507F17_project1_tests.py: contains test cased for above</li>

    show_song() function
    </li>
    <li>requirements.txt: contains short list of required packages that
    need to be installed prior to running either .py file
    </li>
  </ul>

  

<h2>Getting started/Installation:</h2>
  This program runs using python 3.6, so the user must have this version
  installed prior to use. All of the files can be found on GitHub under
  the fellert/507_project1 repository. Fork this folder to your GitHub account,
  make a folder on your computer (mkdir), and clone the 507_project1 folder you
  just forked to the to this folder using the git clone <url> command.

  The packages required to run the programs are listed in the requirements.txt
  file, and can be installed using the pip install -r requirements.txt command.

<h2>Running the Tests:</h2>
  The code for the Cards(), Deck(), play_war_game(), and show_song() is in the
  SI507F17_project1_cards.py file. Running this (using python3) will
  display the scores of each player from the war game, who won (or if there was
  a tie), and the name of the song an artist retrieved from the show_song()
  function. A window will open to iTunes.com as well, displaying the
  song, artist, and album for the object returned.

  Running SI507F17_project1_tests.py will run various tests on each of the
  functions in SI507F17_project1_cards.py, displaying any errors or failure
  along with explanations.
